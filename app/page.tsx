              I have been part of the eu/acc community since
              its inception and have maintained this website
              since 2024. Since late 2024 and early 2025,
              the community has grown and evolved into more of a political
              movement, drifting away from its eu-positive roots. Pieter

              of what eu/acc originally stood for when I
              joined. I believe incorporating political
              views and popularizing anti-EU sentiments is
              counterproductive, as the movement was
              initially about reducing bureaucracy and
              improving the EU for people of all political
              backgrounds.
